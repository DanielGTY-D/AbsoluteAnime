Create a desgin and description for anime page, what i need to crear for my portfolio.

First, I need to create a design for an anime page that showcases various anime series and movies. The design should be visually appealing and user-friendly, allowing visitors to easily navigate through the content.
For example, mi ideas is it have a lateral menu following the modern trend of deveopment, with a dark background and light text. The menu should include categories such as "Popular Anime," "Upcoming Releases," "Genres," and "Top Rated." * Each category should have a dropdown menu for easy access to subcategories, last parte could be or not.

also have a page for add you'r favorite anime for watch later, and a search bar at the top of the page for users to quickly find specific titles. The search bar should be easily accessible and visually integrated into the overall design.
the navbar if this still on the user page, only could search anime of the you added to your favorites.

-- Signup and login page, not have a lateral menu. // take care of this, the design should be simple and clean, with a focus on usability. The signup form should include fields for username, email, and password, while the login form should have fields for username/email and password. Both forms should have clear call-to-action buttons.

colors: how i say previously, want a dark background with light text. The color scheme should be consistent throughout the page, using a combination.

colors: 
--Dark background (e.g., #121212)
--accent-color: (e.g., #FF4081) example: highlighted, text or buttons
--accent-color-hover: (e.g., #FF80AB) example: highlighted, text or buttons
--text-color: (e.g., #FFFFFF) example: text color
----text-color-secondary: (e.g., #B0BEC5) example: secondary text color

ima put a glass efect on the search bar and buttons, using a semi-transparent background with a slight blur effect to create a modern look.

--glass-background: (e.g., rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1))

fonts: 
i need a clearly font for the text, with a modern sans-serif typeface. The font size should be large enough to ensure readability, with appropriate line spacing and letter spacing for a clean look.

aply the primary-font on the global pages, and then it will be change if is necesary 

--primary-font: (e.g., 'Roboto', sans-serif);
--title-font: (e.g., 'Poppins', sans-serif);

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;500;700&family=Poppins:wght@400;500;700&display=swap");


--what i want is a page what other see simple and atractive, it have a lateral menu what still in the layout component, and a main content area that displays the anime series and movies in a grid format. Each item should have a thumbnail image, title, and rating. When a user hovers over an item, a brief description should appear along with a "Watch Now" button.

-- For the login and signup pages, i use a useForm hook to manage form state and validation. The forms should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations. I also want to include error messages for invalid input, such as incorrect email format or password requirements.

--each card still on swiper for more interaction and to make it more dynamic.
    to make this i use a swiper js library, which allows for smooth transitions and easy navigation between items. The swiper should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

-- Menu: example can be moded
    - Popular Anime // so here i put what is the most watched anime
    - Genres // i use a geners what the api.jk give me
        - Action
        - Adventure
        - Comedy
        - Drama
        - Fantasy
        - Horror
        - Romance
        - Sci-Fi
    - Top Rated // in the api i have a top, what is the most popular anime
    - Top manga
-- on the top part of the page or the first page, it will have a long swiper whit the some of most popular anime, with a title and a button to watch now. The swiper should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

below of theme, it will have a short sections for some genres
    - Action
    - Adventure
    - Comedy
    - Drama
    - Fantasy
    - Horror
    - Romance
    - Sci-Fi

and then, also below the long card on the left side i will have a aside for Top Manga.

scss setup usig vite

npm install -D sass 

- create a manin.scs in src/styles and import it in index.jsx
- inside main.scss, import base.scss and any other scss files you need.

- recomende write sccs modules for styles like import './Card.module.scss'.

so i don't know how i the main layout, about recent episodes and the genres, then i searh layouts on pinterest for find some layouts, and i find one that i like, so i will use this for the main layout, and then i will change the colors and some things to make it more personal.
